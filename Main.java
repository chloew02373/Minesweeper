/*
 * Provided in this class is the neccessary code to get started with your game's implementation
 * You will find a while loop that should take your minefield's gameOver() method as its conditional
 * Then you will prompt the user with input and manipulate the data as before in project 2
 * 
 * Things to Note:
 * 1. Think back to Project 1 when we asked our user to give a shape. In this project we will be asking the user to provide a mode. Then create a minefield accordingly
 * 2. You must implement a way to check if we are playing in debug mode or not.
 * 3. When working inside your while loop think about what happens each turn. We get input, user our methods, check their return values. repeat.
 * 4. Once while loop is complete figure out how to determine if the user won or lost. Print appropriate statement.
